# Basic app. Take 2

## Introduction

This app is going to be exactly like `pyside6_example_1` from the previous page except that code will be broken into
a set of files in the following directory structure.

```text
menus/
  file_menu.py
  help_menu.py
  menu_bar.py
panels/
  bottom_panel.py
  main_panel.py
  root_panel.py
  top_panel.py
main.py
main_window.py
```
i.e. every class declaration is placed into its own .py file.
